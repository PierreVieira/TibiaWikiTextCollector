The liberators of the spark by Sericos
Also known as liberators of light and several similar names this Banor sect is dedicated to the so-called 'liberation of the godly spark' from the unworthy. In theory they agree upon the doctrin of the Banor cut that each human and probably some of the non-human races are born with a part of divine essence in them. Whereas other cults are dedicated to make this spark flourish for the good of the individual or civilisation, the liberators argue that certain persons are not worthy of the godly spark and its better to set the divine essence free by killing them in honorary combat. Certain splintergroups of the liberartors go even further and claim that a person can claim the divine essence of those slain to strengthen their own. So this heresy lead to two equally dangerous and forbidden subsects of the banorcult. Whereas the original hereics only killed criminals after their foundation, the term 'unworthy' became more widely used soon. So they slew cowards and erveryone they considered weak. The so called 'new liberators' brought this heresy to another equaly mad degree. They argue that if you can claim the divine spark of others by killing them you should not target the weakbut the mighty. They 'honor' their victims in duells and admittedly more then one new liberator met his well deserved end at the swordtip of an opponent far superior to him. Still there IS a considerable number of new liberators around and doing their perverted work for their god. The curch of Banors in turn has outlawed both heresies and affiliation with on of those sects is punished with lifelong laborcamp or execution.

Legends about the wand of might.
Written by Herion
This book is about the origin of the wand of might. First of all I want to say that nobody is sure who made it and how it was made. But it contains a powerful magic energy of unknown kind. Since we lost most books written by our ancients we cant say how the ancients got the wand in their hands. However, we are very happy that we own it because it helped us and it will help us to understand the magic web around Tibia. For example, only with its help we could find the gates of teleportation of the magic web. We are making right now some experiments with several magic stuff and we hope that the wand of might will react to some of them somehow.
